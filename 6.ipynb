    "The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are crucial tools in time series analysis, particularly for identifying the order of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. ARIMA models are characterized by three parameters: \n",

    "The PACF measures the correlation between observations at different lags while controlling for the correlations at all shorter lags. It isolates the direct effect of past observations on the current value, removing the influence of intermediary values. In ARIMA model selection:\n",

    "�\n",
    "p) and in the ACF plot for an MA component (\n",
    "�\n",
    "q) can sometimes be subjective. Statistical significance tests and model selection criteria (like AIC, BIC) should also guide the choice.\n",
    "Real-world data may not follow theoretical models perfectly, and both plots should be used in conjunction. Sometimes, iterative fitting and model comparison are necessary to identify the best model.\n",
    "The presence of significant spikes at seasonal lags in the ACF and PACF plots may indicate a need for seasonal differencing or the inclusion of seasonal ARIMA components."
